== The change requests 
To make it simple for the reader - we will start with the proposed changes. Then the next of the note will be to describe reasoning behind. 

Proposed changes in the specification: 

1. CALLBACK_NOTIFICATION must be changed to be able to express what kind of notification it is. +
It needs to be able to capture the expected transition and possible some messages from the external system.

2. Introduce an ERROR state + 
To handle all system failures like failure response from external system, timeout, exception when invoking external API. 

== Background 
Performing a system request might be performed synchronized or asynchronized. After the system call is performed the engine will wait for a event which defines the outcome for the request. 

The specification defines that the event to wait for is a CALLBACK_NOTIFICATION. CALLBACK_NOTIFICATION is an _"event generated on receipt of notification of completion of a Dispatchable Task"_. The definition of the attribute in CALLBACK_WAIT is a  _"callback notification on which this Callback wait state is based"_. 

The image below illustrate such an example with the classes and attributes involved. In this note we will follow a use case with a SYSTEM_REQUEST to a scheduling system. The method to be invoked in the SCHEDULING system is NEWAPPOINTMENT. The expected result is that the appointment is made.

== Execution log  
Below is a JSON structure to define a pseudo-log of what happens during execution of such a PLAN. The purpose of the log is to tell. 

WARNING: The JSON is NOT of any RM Type - the only purpose is to write out a fictive execution log. 

.Definition of the attributes
[horizontal]
time:: When it happended 
event:: What kind of external/internal event triggered the action 
action:: The action that the TP engine performs based on the event 
state:: The state after the execution of the action

== Possible outcomes of the request 

Now the engine is waiting for the external system (the scheduling system). There will be several possible outcomes of the external operation: 

1. Happy case! + 
The external system and it's users finishes the given task. 
2. Other transitions + 
The external system is not able to finish the task and performed another legal transition on the task 
3. Failure + 
The external system where not able to process the request and makes an error report back 
4. Timeout + 
The external system didn't respond within the given timeframe


=== Success

==== The happy case 

[source,json]
----
		{
            "time":"T3.1 Happy-case", 
            "event":"Engine receives callback about finished task", 
            "event_callback_on_rest_api": {
                "REST_PATH": "/task/{task_id}",
                "task_id": "Task-A", 
                "transition": "finished"
            },
            "action":"Set SCHEDULE to completed", 
            "state":{
                "Task-A": "completed", 
                "WORKPLAN": "materialized"
            }

        }
----

==== Other transitions 

[source,json]
----
        {
            "time":"T3.2 Other-transition", 
            "event":"Engine receives not finished transition", 
            "event_callback_on_rest_api": {
                "REST_PATH":"/task/{task_id}", 
                "task_id":"Task-A", 
                "transition": "Possible values -> suspend|cant_complete|resume|not_needed"
            }, 
            "action": "Update SCHEDULE with given transition - here not_needed", 
            "state": {
                "Task-A": "cancelled", 
                "WORKPLAN": "terminated"
            }
        }
----

=== Failure and timeout 
TIP: Look at the state for Task-A after a failure. It is set to ERROR since the engine have no way to define an ERROR state which is not clinical. 

==== Failure 


[source,json]
----
{
            "time":"T3.3 Failure in external system", 
            "event":"External system where not able to process SYSTEM_REQUEST", 
            "action":"Some undefined failure in callback???? ", 
            "state": {
                "Task-A": "ERROR", 
                "WORKPLAN": "active"
            }
        }
----

==== Timeout 


[source,json]
----
{
            "time": "T3.4 Timeout",
            "event":"Engine notifies timeout on SCHEDULE TASK", 
            "action": "update SCHEDULE with timeout", 
            "state": {
                "Task-A": "ERROR", 
                "WORKPLAN": "active"
            }
        }

    ]
}

== More about CALLBACK_NOTICICATION 

CALLBACK_NOTIFICATION inherit from PLAN_EVENT. There are several classes which inherit from PLAN_EVENT as shown in the image below. The events are described here: http://www.openehr.org/releases/PROC/latest/docs/task_planning/task_planning.html#_event_types[] 

Below I have picked some which might be of interest for SYSTEM_REQUEST. For the usage with SYSTEM_REQUEST I think both _TASK_TRANSITION_ and _SYSTEM_NOTIFICATION_ might be used. 


. *CALLBACK_NOTIFICATION*: a callback notification connected to a dispatch call for a Dispatchable Task (Hand-off, External Request, System Request);
. *TASK_TRANSITION*: an event corresponding to a lifecycle transition of a Task, such as being cancelled or done;
. *SYSTEM_NOTIFICATION*: an event that is notified to the Plan execution engine by a system or service;

EVENT_ACTION ::

Action(s) to perform on receipt of an event with a particular status. If resume_action is set, it dictates where execution resumes; if not, the default is to resume at the next Task in normal execution flow.


RESUME_ACTION ::

Type representing an execution jump to a new location in the current Plan.
